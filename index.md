## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2 Part 2
One of my favorite labs was lab 2 part 2 because this was the lab where I started to understand how VS Code worked.The lab taught me what “cout” and “cin” is and what it meant. Because of it I started to understand how a computer works in inputting and outputting texts and how a computer processes it. 

Lab 4 Part 2
Lab 4 part 2 was definitely one of my favortie labs ive done because it taught me if statements which really opened my eyes, it made me think more about how coding works in our daily lives. For example a machine that detects movement may have code that says if there is movement, take picture.

Lab 7 part 1
This was also one of my favorite labs as well, because in this lab we were taught arguments and how they be applied in the real world. We built a program that is able to calculate the difference of two dates. Again arguments helped me think about how code works in the real world in applications.
